# DQN-Reinforcement-Learning

<p> DQN is introduced in 2 papers, <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf">Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning</a> on NIPS in 2013 and Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning on Nature in 2015. Interestingly, 
there were only few papers about DRN between 2013 and 2015. 
I guess that the reason was people couldnâ€™t reproduce DQN implementation without information in Nature version.</p>
